An app that shows examples of photonic usage.  This was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# IMPORTANT
To edit the photonic lib and see the effects in this example app, you must manually copy the photonic index file into this directory.  There is a Makefile provided to do this for you and to trigger the copying when you change the source photonic file.
